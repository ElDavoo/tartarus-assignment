The Tartarus MCU assignment
===========================
"In Greek mythology, Tartarus is the deep abyss that is used as a dungeon of torment and suffering 
for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans." (Wikipedia)

In other words, Tartarus is not a fine place to be. In order to exit from Tartarus, you have
to complete the assignment ;).

First, take a look at the slides (check the docs/ folder) for the specifications of this assignement.
You _MUST NOT_ touch mcu.c, mcu-api.h. 

If you use gcc compiler you can use the following command to compile:

   gcc lib-periph.c firmware.c mcu.c -o firmware

Obviously, the main() must be implemented in firmware.c according to specifics (slide n. 9).

Have fun coding with the Tartarus MCU.
